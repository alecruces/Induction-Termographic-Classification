# Induction-Thermographic-Classification
Utilizing deep learning models like GoogleNet to classify termographic images of induction motors, detecting levels of failures efficiently.

---
##  Description 
This project classifies thermographic images of induction motors failures using GoogleNet and ShuffleNet convolutional neural networks with transfer learning. Both models achieved high test set accuracy of 97%, with ShuffleNet offering faster training and inference times, making it ideal for resource-limited environments. Transfer learning significantly enhanced performance over training from scratch. The results were competitive with previous studies using more complex models. This study highlights the potential of CNNs with transfer learning for efficient and accurate industrial fault diagnosis.
